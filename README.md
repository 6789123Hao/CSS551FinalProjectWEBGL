# [Kiiicking Kans](https://6789123hao.github.io/CSS551FinalProjectWEBGL/)

This application allows the user to play a game that models a soccer penalty kick. The user plays as a stack of cola kans kicking the soccer ball. Dragging with the mouse kicks the ball in the opposite direction with a similar magnitude to the length of the drag. Pressing or clicking ESC can bring up the pause menu. The user can kick a curved ball in the direction rotated by pressing Q or E on the keyboard, clicking the UI buttons, or using the mouse scroll. Scoring is based on how many consecutive goals were made, how complex the ball path was to make the goal, and where the ball entered the goal. Each goal creates a blocking can that will move randomly in a fixed area to prevent further goals.
